							<h2>From Philosophy to Computer Science</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Through academic training in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,_politics_and_economics'>PPE <sup>Phil, PoliSci & Econ</sup></a> 
							at <a href='https://www.pku.edu.cn'>Peking University</a> – one of the best universities across China – 
							I've found my passion in philosophy and become qualified as a young Kant scholar. 
							During my undergraduate study, I've won many awards and scholarships, including 
							<a href='https://baike.baidu.com/item/国家奖学金/9693046'>the National Scholarship</a>, 
							which is awarded only to top 0.2% students in China.</p>
							<p>When serving as a TA in philosophy courses, I found the revealing insights in my eyes 
							can be every difficult for others to approach, including students in my class.
							This became the occasion for my CS skills, which have heitherto escorted me to 
							success in German language learning, to find their way into <a href='bert.html'>a interdisciplinary 
							research project</a> listed below.</p>
							<p>When dabbling in the project, I found my enthusiathm about CS beyond the sketchy summary 
								of “interdisciplinary research”. It simply gives me <strong>a strong feeling of fulfillment</strong>, 
								when I see that my students finally got a grasp of Kantian philosophy, following the clue 
								provided by my project. Being able to reach something more easily – this is also exactly
								how I felt when a few scripts helped me learn german much more efficiently.</p>
								<p><strong>Assistances from cutting-edge technology to make life better</strong> 
								– that's what I see in a professional career in CS. I would be thrilled if I  
								could deepen my knowledge and skills in NLP within a MS program in CS, yet utility 
								of my future works doesn't have to be limited to the field of philosophy. </p>
